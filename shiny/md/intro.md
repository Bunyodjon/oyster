## TfL Oyster Data Explorer
***

### What is this app?

This is a simple Shiny application created as part of the [_Developing Data Products_](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course offered by John's Hopkins University on the Coursera platform.

The app allows a user to explore data for the creator's activity on [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) (TfL - the London transport network. The data are sourced from the  journeys made using an [Oyster card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster), which TfL kindly provide in a weekly file (_.csv_). Long term development plans for this app include the ability for others to upload their own data to see similar results.
