## TfL Oyster Data Explorer
***

This is a simple Shiny application created as part of the [_Developing Data Products_](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course offered by John's Hopkins University on the Coursera platform.

The data presented are those for the creator's activity on the London transport network. The data are sourced from the creator's [Oyster](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster) card. Long term development plans for this app include the ability for others to upload their own data to see similar results.
